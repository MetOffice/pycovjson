Installation:
=============
If you already have netCDF4 and hdf5 installed, the installation process is simple.
Open up a command line and type the following:
```
$ pip install pycovjson
```
If not, you will need to download [conda](http://anaconda.org) for your operating system,
details of how to do this can be found [here.](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html)
After you have installed conda, type the following in the command line:
```
$ conda install netcdf4
$ pip install pycovjson
```
Conda will install all of the required binaries for your OS.
